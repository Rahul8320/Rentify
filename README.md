## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project provides a robust and scalable platform for property search, enabling buyers to find their dream homes and sellers to effortlessly list their properties.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features <a name="features"></a>

- **Property Search:**
  - Buyers can search for properties based on various criteria, including:
    - Number of bedrooms
    - Location (including search by radius or specific addresses)
    - Nearby places (e.g., schools, parks, restaurants)
  - Enhanced search experience with user-friendly filtering and sorting options.
- **Property Listing:**
  - Sellers can register and log in to the system.
  - Sellers can add new properties with detailed descriptions, photos, and relevant information.
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Secure user authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity Server.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized actions.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Technologies <a name="technologies"></a>

**Backend:**

- ASP.NET Core: A robust and flexible framework for building web APIs.
- Identity Server: Secure user authentication and management.
- CQRS Pattern: Efficient handling of read and write operations for improved scalability.
- Serilog: Comprehensive and structured logging for better application monitoring.
- In-Memory Caching: Caching frequently accessed data for faster performance.

**Frontend:**

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.
- TypeScript: Typed JavaScript extension for enhanced code maintainability and catch errors early.
- Redux (or Context API): State management solution for managing application state in the frontend (replace with your chosen library).
- React Hook Form: Efficient form handling and validation.
